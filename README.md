# 2D Transformations Console Application

This project is a simple C# console application that demonstrates the core concepts of **2D geometric transformations** used in computer graphics.

## 📌 Transformations Implemented
- Translation
- Scaling
- Rotation (Clockwise & Anti-clockwise)
- Reflection (X-axis & Y-axis)
- Shearing

## 🧮 Description
The program defines a triangular shape using three points, then applies various 2D transformations on these points and prints the results to the console.

This project was created as part of a **Computer Graphics / Mathematics** academic task to understand how transformations work at a mathematical level.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Console Application

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the solution file (`ConsoleApp3.sln`) in Visual Studio
2. Build the project
3. Run the application
4. View transformation results in the console

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding 2D transformation mathematics
- Applying translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, and shearing
- Using trigonometric functions in C#

## 📌 Notes
- Rotation angle is converted from degrees to radians before applying trigonometric functions.
- Points are hardcoded for simplicity and clarity.
